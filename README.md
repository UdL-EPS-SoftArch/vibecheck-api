## Vision

**For** Erasmus students **who want to** easily find and organize local activities, **the VibeCheck project is an** event management and social discovery platform **that allows** users to explore, create, and join student events on an interactive map. **Unlike other** general social media platforms or scattered messaging groups, VibeCheck provides a single centralized hub specifically tailored for the international student community.
